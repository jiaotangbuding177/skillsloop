# EXR Converter

Desktop app and CLI for converting between **video** and **OpenEXR** sequences with **OpenColorIO** color management and built-in **slate rendering**. Uses **PyAV** for decode/encode, **OpenImageIO** for EXR I/O, and **PySide6** (QPainter) for the GUI and slate compositing.

Targets the [VFX Reference Platform CY2026](https://vfxplatform.com/#reference-platform): Python 3.13, Qt/PySide 6.8, OpenColorIO 2.5, OpenEXR 3.4, NumPy 2.3.

### Running on macOS

These builds use an **ad-hoc code signature** and are **not Apple-notarized** (like most open-source apps distributed outside the App Store). Because of that, Gatekeeper quarantines the download. After dragging **EXR Converter.app** into `/Applications`, clear the quarantine flag once from Terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/EXR Converter.app"
```

Then open it normally (double-click, or right-click → **Open**). If macOS still says the app "is damaged" or "can't be opened," that is the quarantine flag — the `xattr -cr` command above resolves it. This is the [standard macOS prompt](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445) for apps without a paid Apple Developer signature; it does not indicate a problem with the build.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Notes |
|-------|--------|
| **Language & tooling** | Python 3.13, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for deps and runs, [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) in CI, [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) for standalone bundles |
| **UI** | [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/) (Qt 6.8), Nuke-inspired dark theme |
| **Imaging & color** | [OpenImageIO](https://openimageio.org/) (`oiio-python`), [OpenColorIO 2.5](https://opencolorio.org/) display/render transforms with a wide-gamut scene-linear **compositing space** for all overlay (slate / burn-in / watermark) compositing — prefers **ACES2065-1 (AP0)** via the `aces_interchange` role so sRGB-authored overlays are linearised and alpha-over'd without ever clipping or shifting the user's footage; falls back to the `scene_linear` role (e.g. ACEScg) on non-ACES configs.<br>Bundles the official **ACES Studio Config v4** (from [ASWF OpenColorIO-Config-ACES](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO-Config-ACES), BSD-3-Clause) which includes dozens of camera IDTs including **Apple Log** (iPhone 15/16 Pro cinematic / ProRes Log), ARRI LogC3/4, RED Log3G10, Sony S-Log/Venice, Canon, DJI, and many more. |
| **Video & sequences** | [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV) (FFmpeg bindings) for video I/O, [fileseq](https://github.com/justinfx/fileseq) for frame sequences & ranges |
| **Slate / burn-in / watermark** | Native **QPainter** preview and offscreen capture (no embedded browser); burn-in and watermark are linearised into the working space and alpha-composited per-frame, then OCIO-transformed to display before encode |

CI runs on **GitHub Actions**; releases publish binaries for Linux, macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel), and Windows.

## GUI

```bash
uv run python main.py
```

No subcommand — opens the main window. OCIO resolution follows `$OCIO` when set, otherwise the bundled **ACES Studio Config v4 (ACES 2.0)** — the official rich config from the Academy Software Foundation containing a huge set of camera input transforms including **Apple Log** (for iPhone 15/16 Pro cinematic video and ProRes Log), ARRI LogC3/4, RED, Sony, Canon, DJI and many others, plus modern ACES Output Transforms and displays. 

Common camera source names (when using the default ACES Studio config): "Apple Log" (or "apple_log", "iphone log"), "ARRI LogC3 (EI800)", "Log3G10 REDWideGamutRGB", etc. The UI source picker groups them under families like Input/Apple, Input/ARRI, etc. You can also pass `--ocio /path/to/your.config.ocio` or choose other built-ins / custom in the UI.

Enable the **Prepend slate** checkbox to add a 1-frame slate image before the converted output.

## CLI

Use the `video2exr` or `exr2video` subcommand.

**Video → EXR**

```bash
uv run python main.py video2exr -i clip.mov -o ./exr_out/
```

**EXR → video**

```bash
uv run python main.py exr2video -i "./plate.####.exr" -o review.mov --fps 24
```

Common options:

| Option | Applies to | Notes |
|--------|------------|--------|
| `--ocio PATH` | both | OCIO config file (overrides `$OCIO`) |
| `--src` / `--dst` | both | OCIO display / scene color space names |
| `--workers N` | both | `0` = auto, `1` = single-threaded |
| `--scale FACTOR` | both | e.g. `0.5` for half resolution |
| `--exr-compression NAME` | `video2exr` | e.g. `dwaa`, `zip`, `none` (see `--help`) |
| `--codec KEY` | `exr2video` | e.g. `prores`, `h264`, `prores_4444`, `dnxhr_hq`, `ffv1` |

Run `uv run python main.py video2exr --help` or `exr2video --help` for the full list.

## Requirements (running from source)

- **Python 3.13**
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or another PEP 621-compatible installer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/derek-rein/exr-converter.git
cd exr-converter
uv sync
```

## Building from source

Prerequisites: **Python 3.13**, [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and a C compiler (Xcode CLT on macOS, MSVC on Windows, gcc on Linux).

```bash
uv sync
make bundle
```

This uses [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) to produce a standalone distributable:

| Platform | Output |
|----------|--------|
| macOS | `dist/EXR Converter.app` |
| Linux | `dist/exr_converter` (single binary) |
| Windows | `dist\main.dist\` (folder with `exr_converter.exe` + dependencies) |

Nuitka will auto-download `ccache` on first run. See the `Makefile` for the full set of flags.

## Development

| Target | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `make run` | Start the GUI |
| `make lint` / `make fmt` | Ruff check / format |
| `make test` | Run the pytest suite |
| `make resources` | Regenerate `src/rc_resources.py` from `resources.qrc` (needed after icon changes) |
| `make bundle` | Nuitka standalone bundle under `dist/` |
| `make clean` | Remove all build artifacts |

All static assets live under `resources/`: icons in `resources/icons/` (`icon.icns` / `icon.ico` / `icon.png`), UI images in `resources/images/`, the Qt stylesheet at `resources/style.qss`, the bundled OCIO config in `resources/ocio/`, and docs imagery in `resources/screenshots/`.

## Releases

Tags use plain semver: `v1.2.3`. Pushing a tag runs [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) and publishes a GitHub Release with Linux AppImage, macOS DMGs (ARM64 + Intel), and a Windows installer.

```bash
make help
make release PART=patch        # bump + commit + tag + push (triggers Release workflow)
make release PUSH=0            # local only; push branch + tag yourself when ready
```

CI for lint: [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
