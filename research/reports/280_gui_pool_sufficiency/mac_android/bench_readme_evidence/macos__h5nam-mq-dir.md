## Why

A modern coding session is half source, half artifacts: generated images, recorded demos, PDFs, screenshots from QA, exported transcripts, downloaded models, design specs. None of it lives where your code does — and Finder wasn't built for that volume or for the way agents now produce work in parallel.

mq-dir gives you up to four independent panes side by side. One per project, one per agent, one for the artifact dump. Each pane keeps its own folder, sort, scroll position, and column widths — and remembers them across launches and force-quits.

## Features

- 🟦 **1 / 2H / 2V / 4-pane layouts** — focused-pane routing, independent folder per pane.
- ↹ **Per-pane tabs** — Safari-style strip with X/+, ⌘T / ⌘W / ⌘⇧T / ⌘1…⌘9 / ⌘⇧[ / ⌘⇧], drag-to-reorder, drag a tab onto Favorites to bookmark its folder, right-click Close Other / Close to Right / Duplicate, last-tab safety placeholder.
- 🌳 **VS Code-style tree view** — per-tab toggle, lazy child loading, separate chevron hit target (clicking a folder name selects without expanding), Shift / Cmd multi-select, file drag-out to external apps. New tabs via **⌘+double-click** or **⌘+Enter** on a folder (same as list view).
- ⌨️ **Keyboard nav + Finder-parity right-click** — ↑/↓ step through rows (hold to repeat, Shift to extend the selection); Return opens, ⌘+Return opens in a new tab. Row context menu covers Open With ▸ (LaunchServices candidates + Other…), Get Info, Reveal in Finder, Copy / Copy Path, Duplicate, Rename, and Move to Trash. Multi-selection right-clicks act on the whole selection. Restoring keyboard focus after a rename is handled correctly in both list and tree view.
- ⚙️ **Settings → Shortcuts** — 17 actions re-bindable from Preferences (⌘,), including F1…F12. Reset-to-default per row.
- 👀 **Per-tab preview pane** — toggle in the pane header (or ⌘⇧P). PDFs render through PDFKit with continuous scroll + paging; everything else routes through Quick Look for images, code, video, audio, office docs (DOCX/PPTX/XLSX). MarkdownUI handles `.md` with full GFM (tables, code blocks, lists). Folder/multi/empty selections get custom summaries. Zip archives preview in-pane (listing + single-entry decode). Multi-page navigation for non-PDF documents and formats macOS Quick Look has no generator for (HWP, etc.) is best done with ⎵ to summon the floating Quick Look panel, or ⇧↩ to open in the system default app (e.g. Hancom Office Viewer for HWP).
- 🏷️ **Finder tag display** — per-tag colour swatches (red / orange / yellow / green / blue / purple / grey) read straight from macOS metadata, including multi-tag rows. Sidebar Tags section lists every tag in the current folder. Read-only — applying or editing tags happens in Finder.
- 📂 **Custom folder icons** — folders with a Finder-assigned custom icon (Get Info → drag image) render that icon in the row, not the system default.
- ⭐ **User-editable Favorites sidebar** — drag folders in (or drag a tab in to bookmark its folder), right-click Remove or Rename, drag to reorder, ⌘⇧D adds the focused pane's folder. Real Finder folder icons, stale-path styling.
- 📁 **Projects (workspaces)** — named snapshots of (layout + pane tabs + focus). + button creates one, click switches, right-click Rename / Delete, drag to reorder. Switching auto-saves the outgoing project.
- 💾 **State persistence** — every pane / tab / favorite / project survives relaunch, force-quit, and even schema upgrades (legacy `state.json` shapes auto-migrate).
- 🔎 **Per-pane recursive search** — debounced, case-insensitive substring match across the current folder's subtree. ⌘F.
- 🔄 **In-app auto-update** — Sparkle 2 polls the appcast every 24 h; when a new release is out, the sidebar grows an "Update Available" button that runs the standard install/relaunch flow.
- 💬 **In-app Send Feedback** — sidebar footer → send a short note with optional screenshots straight to the maintainer (no email client involved).
- 🔗 **[cmux](https://cmux.com) sync** — sidebar grows a CMUX section that mirrors your cmux workspaces. Click a row to open its working directory in the focused pane (⌘-click for a new tab). cmux ships with the socket locked to its own children, so pick one of:
  - **Quick:** cmux → Settings → Automation → Socket Control Mode = Allow All.
  - **Stricter:** Socket Control Mode = Password, then `launchctl setenv CMUX_SOCKET_PASSWORD <pw>` (so the env var reaches GUI-launched apps) and relaunch mq-dir.

  Section stays hidden when cmux isn't installed.
- 🎨 **Native macOS look** — SwiftUI + AppKit, system theme tokens, hand-finished app icon.

**Roadmap**

- 3-pane layout option.
- More archive formats in-pane (tar / 7z / rar).
- Open to ideas — file an issue or use the in-app Send Feedback.

## Status

**v0.1.0 — first non-beta cut.** Each tagged build is Developer ID-signed and Apple-notarized. The feature set above has been daily-driven by the maintainer and a small early-adopter group; expect occasional rough edges around ergonomics. Per-release detail lives on the [Releases page](https://github.com/h5nam/mq-dir/releases).

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel
- For building: Xcode 15+, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)

## Install

### From the signed DMG (recommended)

Grab the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/h5nam/mq-dir/releases) and drag `mq-dir.app` into `/Applications`. Notarized + stapled, so Gatekeeper opens it without a right-click trick. The running app then auto-updates via Sparkle on its 24-hour cadence (or whenever you click the sidebar's "Update Available" button).

### Via Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask h5nam/mq-dir/mq-dir
```

`brew` tap-installs the formula on first use — no separate `brew tap` needed. Subsequent updates are `brew upgrade --cask mq-dir`. The cask points at the same signed DMG as above; the tap repo ([`h5nam/homebrew-mq-dir`](https://github.com/h5nam/homebrew-mq-dir)) is refreshed automatically by the release workflow.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h5nam/mq-dir.git
cd mq-dir
Scripts/bootstrap.sh   # installs XcodeGen and the xcodes CLI
open mq-dir.xcodeproj
```

`bootstrap.sh` generates `mq-dir.xcodeproj` from `project.yml` (XcodeGen is the source of truth — the `.xcodeproj` is not checked in).

**Tests-only** (no Xcode required, just the Swift toolchain):

```bash
swift test
```

## Privacy

**No telemetry. No crash reporting. No analytics. Ever, in v1.**

mq-dir is local-only for everything except the auto-update check. It reads your filesystem to show it back to you and writes its own state to `~/Library/Application Support/com.mqdir.app/`. The single network egress is Sparkle fetching `https://h5nam.github.io/mq-dir/appcast.xml` once a day to look for a newer release; nothing else phones home.

If a v1.x release ever proposes opt-in crash reporting, it will land behind a config toggle defaulting to off, with the source clearly visible.

## Out of scope for v1

Cloud sync, file editing, plugins, iPadOS/iOS port, localization beyond English. Archive *editing* (we preview zip in-pane; tar / 7z / rar previews are on the roadmap, not write support).

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Contributions are accepted via [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/) — every commit needs a `Signed-off-by:` line. **No CLA.** See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the workflow, [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability disclosure, and [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Releasing (maintainers only)

```bash
Scripts/release.sh 0.1.1
```

That's it. The script bumps the version, builds Release with Developer ID, re-signs every nested binary inside-out (Sparkle's helpers don't auto-inherit signing), notarizes via the stored `mq-dir-notary` keychain profile + staples, builds and EdDSA-signs the DMG, appends a fresh `<item>` to `docs/appcast.xml`, bumps `Casks/mq-dir.rb`, tags + pushes, and creates the GitHub release.

**One-time setup** (per maintainer machine):

```bash
Scripts/sparkle-setup.sh
# → downloads Sparkle binary tools, generates the EdDSA key pair in your
#   macOS keychain, prints the public half. Already embedded in
#   project.yml's SUPublicEDKey for this project; only needed if a
#   future maintainer rotates the key.

xcrun notarytool store-credentials mq-dir-notary \
    --apple-id <your-apple-id> --team-id WKV6T7K33K \
    --password <app-specific-password>

brew install create-dmg
gh auth login
```

Plus give codesign access to the Developer ID private key once: Keychain Access → login → My Certificates → expand `Developer ID Application: …` → right-click the private key → Get Info → Access Control → **Allow all applications to access this item**. Without this, every release prompts for your Mac password ~10 times during the inside-out re-sign.

GitHub Pages is already enabled on `main` / `/docs` so the appcast at `https://h5nam.github.io/mq-dir/appcast.xml` updates within a minute of every push.
