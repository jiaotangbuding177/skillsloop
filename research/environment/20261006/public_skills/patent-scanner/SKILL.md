# Patent Scanner

## Agent Identity

**Role**: Help users discover what makes their concepts distinctive
**Approach**: Provide structured analysis with clear scoring and evidence
**Boundaries**: Illuminate patterns, never make legal determinations
**Tone**: Precise, encouraging, honest about uncertainty
**Safety**: This skill operates entirely locally. It does not transmit concept descriptions, analysis results, or any data to external services. This skill does not modify, delete, or write any files.

## Patent Attorney Methodology (John Branch)

This skill incorporates patterns from patent attorney John Branch:

### Key Insight: Lossy Abstraction is a Feature

> "I don't need to see the code to draft claims. I need to understand what the
> invention IS." — John Branch

**Why this matters**: Broad claims are harder to design around. Implementation
details limit claim scope. Focus on the CORE MECHANISM, not the IMPLEMENTATION.

### The Abstraction Principle (JB-2)

If your description could only apply to YOUR implementation, it's too narrow.
If a competitor could implement it differently and the description still applies, it's appropriately broad.

When describing concepts, abstract from specific implementations:

| Concept Description (Skip) | Abstraction (Use) |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| "Uses machine learning to predict" | "Applies pattern recognition to forecast" |
| "Blockchain-based verification" | "Distributed consensus validation" |
| "GPS tracking of shipments" | "Location-aware logistics coordination" |
| "Natural language processing" | "Semantic content analysis" |
| "Cloud-based storage" | "Remotely accessible persistent data" |

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user asks to:
- "Analyze my concept"
- "What's distinctive about this?"
- "Break down my concept into components"
- "Find the sophisticated aspects"
- "Score my concept"

## Important Limitations

- This is TECHNICAL analysis, not legal advice
- Output identifies "potentially distinctive aspects" not "patentable inventions"
- Cannot search existing implementations (use patent-validator for that)
- Always recommend professional consultation for IP decisions

---

## Input Requirements

User provides:
- Natural language description of your concept
- Problem being solved
- How it works (technical detail)
- What makes it different
- (Optional) Target industry/field

## Analysis Framework

### Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Range | What It Measures |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Distinctiveness | 0-4 | How unique is this combination? |
| Sophistication | 0-3 | Technical complexity of the approach |
| System Impact | 0-3 | Scope of the technical contribution |
| Frame Shift | 0-3 | Does this redefine how to think about the problem? |

**Total Score**: Sum of all dimensions (0-13)
**Reporting Threshold**: Report a pattern only when its total is >= 8 **and** its Distinctiveness score is >= 2

`CALIBRATE:` both values are starting points, subject to revision as eval data accrues. The Distinctiveness minimum exists because the total alone admits a pattern with no distinctiveness (0 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 9); it is 2 because levels 0 and 1 describe a standard approach and a common pattern with minor variation.

### 1. Component Breakdown

For the described concept, identify:
- All technologies/methods being combined
- Source domain for each component
- Standard vs. custom implementation
- What each component contributes

### 2. Combination Analysis

Analyze the combination:
- What emerges from the combination?
- Unexpected synergies (1+1=3)
- Why haven't others combined these?
- Technical barriers overcome

### 3. Problem-Solution Mapping

Map problem to solution:
- Technical problem addressed
- How combination solves it
- Quantifiable benefits (if known)
- Comparison to existing approaches

### 4. Sophistication Assessment

Evaluate sophistication:
- Why this combination shows technical sophistication
- Barriers that existed before
- Challenges in existing implementations
- What makes this approach different

### 5. Problem-Solution-Benefit Mapping (JB-1)

Structure each pattern as:

| Element | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **Problem** | What specific technical limitation exists today? |
| **Solution** | How does this approach address it (explain HOW)? |
| **Benefit** | What measurable advantage results? |

**Quality check**: Problem must be SPECIFIC, Solution must explain HOW (not just WHAT),
Benefit must be MEASURABLE.

### 6. Claim Angle Generation (JB-5)

For patterns that meet the reporting threshold (see Scoring Dimensions), generate three claim framings:

1. **Method claim**: Process steps
2. **System claim**: Components and their arrangement
3. **Apparatus claim**: Physical or logical structure

**Example** (same pattern, three angles):

> **Pattern**: Real-time collaborative editing with conflict resolution

- **Method**: "A method for synchronizing document edits comprising detecting concurrent changes, applying operational transformation, and merging without data loss"
- **System**: "A system comprising an edit detection module, a transformation engine, and a conflict resolver configured to merge concurrent modifications"
- **Apparatus**: "An apparatus for collaborative authoring including change buffers, transformation logic, and consistency enforcement mechanisms"

## Scoring Guide

**Distinctiveness (0-4)**:
- 0: Standard approach, widely used
- 1: Common pattern with minor variation
- 2: Meaningful customization of known approach
- 3: Distinctive combination or significant innovation
- 4: Genuinely unique approach

**Sophistication (0-3)**:
- 0: Straightforward implementation
- 1: Some clever optimizations
- 2: Complex but well-structured
- 3: Highly elegant solution to hard problem

**System Impact (0-3)**:
- 0: Isolated utility
- 1: Affects one subsystem
- 2: Cross-cutting concern
- 3: Foundational to system architecture

**Frame Shift (0-3)**:
- 0: Works within existing paradigm
- 1: Questions one assumption
- 2: Challenges core approach
- 3: Redefines the problem entirely

### Patent Value Signals (JB-3)

In addition to the distinctiveness score, assess patent value signals:

| Signal | Range | Criteria |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Market Demand** | low/medium/high | Would customers pay for this capability? |
| **Competitive Value** | low/medium/high | Is this worth disclosing via patent? |
| **Distinctiveness Confidence** | low/medium/high | Distinctive approach or good engineering? |

**Advisory signals**: JB-3 signals are advisory only — displayed alongside the 4-dimension
score but do NOT affect the reporting threshold. The 4-dimension score remains the
primary filter; JB-3 provides additional context for prioritization.

### Final Analysis: Product Centrality and Defensibility

After scoring patterns on the four distinctiveness dimensions and the JB-3 signals, emit a per-pattern Final Analysis to help the user prioritize which patterns are worth attorney consultation time. This is **not a patentability assessment** — it is workload prioritization for the human attorney.

For each pattern that meets the reporting threshold, score two axes:

| Axis | Range | Question |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Product Centrality** | 0.0-1.0 | How central is this mechanism to the user's stated product? Would removing it materially change what the product does? |
| **Defensibility** | 0.0-1.0 | How hard would a competitor have to work to design around this mechanism? Is the technique itself the moat, or is there a readily available workaround? |

Each score MUST be accompanied by a sentence-level **rationale** — the score alone is uninterpretable; the rationale is what the attorney can evaluate without taking the score at face value.

**Recommendation rule**:

```
recommend_attorney_consultation = product_centrality > 0.5 AND defensibility > 0.5
```

- If true → **"Recommended for attorney consultation"**
- If false → **"Engineering note only — attorney consultation likely not productive"**

`CALIBRATE:` the `> 0.5` floor is a starting point, and it applies to each axis on its own so that a single high score cannot trigger the recommendation. An average of the two would not hold that line: 0.95 and 0.10 average 0.525 and would pass. The floor is subject to revision as eval data accrues; do not treat it as a load-bearing claim.

**Decisive caveat**: this recommendation answers "is this concept worth the attorney's billable hour?" — it does NOT answer "is this concept patentable?". Patentability is a legal determination only a qualified attorney can make. The user owns the legal judgment; this scoring just routes attention.

**Precedence and independence**: if the `recommend_attorney_consultation` gate and the JB-3 advisory signals point different directions for the same pattern, the recommendation gate wins for prioritization (JB-3 stays context-only). Score `product_centrality` and `defensibility` independently of the X/13 distinctiveness total — a pattern can be highly distinctive yet low-centrality (worth surfacing as an engineering note, not worth an attorney's time), or the reverse. Do not anchor the 0–1 axes to the distinctiveness score.

## Error Handling

**Insufficient Description**:
```
I need more detail to generate useful analysis. What's the technical mechanism? What problem does it solve? What makes it different?
```

**No Distinctive Aspects Found**:
```
No patterns met the reporting threshold (8/13, with Distinctiveness 2 or higher). This may mean the distinctiveness is in execution, not architecture. Try adding more specific technical details about HOW it works.
```

## Audit Trail

**2026-06-22** — Replaced "inventive concept" with "core mechanism" in the JSON template field. The phrase "inventive concept" is the Alice/Mayo §101 term-of-art for patent-eligibility analysis; as a model instruction it directed the LLM toward §101-flavored output, a UPL boundary risk for a public OSS skill. Replacement chosen via noun-swap eval (candidates: `core mechanism`, `underlying technical approach`, `load-bearing technique`) on a representative multi-category code sample. The eval found `core mechanism` and `underlying technical approach` produced closely similar outputs (effectively interchangeable), while `load-bearing technique` diverged by narrowing JB-2 abstraction from mechanism-as-system toward a single keystone technique, weakening claim breadth. Among the interchangeable pair, `core mechanism` was selected for cleanest UPL semantics, alignment with the existing `abstract_mechanism` JSON field name, and universal fit across algorithmic / architectural / data-structure / integration concept categories.

**2026-06-22** — Renamed the "Novelty Confidence" scoring axis to "Distinctiveness Confidence" (including the `novelty_confidence` JSON field → `distinctiveness_confidence` and the `🟢 Novelty` share-card column → `🟢 Distinctiveness`). The previous axis name contradicted this file's own banned-vocabulary list (`"novel" (legal sense)`); the new name mirrors platform-side engineering vocabulary and removes the §102 Patent Act term-of-art from the user-facing scoring surface.

**2026-06-22** — Removed `patentability` from the frontmatter tag list (replaced with `attorney-consultation-prep` and `distinctiveness-audit`) and added a "Final Analysis: Product Centrality and Defensibility" step that emits per-pattern `product_centrality` and `defensibility` scores ∈ [0, 1] with sentence-level rationales, plus a `recommend_attorney_consultation` boolean computed as `(product_centrality + defensibility) / 2 > 0.5`. The threshold is marked `CALIBRATE:` (subject to revision as eval data accrues). The previous `Novelty` share-card column was replaced with `Centrality` / `Defensibility` / `Consult?` columns. The decisive framing: the recommendation answers "is this concept worth the attorney's billable hour?" — not "is this concept patentable?" Centrality and defensibility are engineering / commercial facts the user can evaluate; patentability remains a legal determination only a qualified attorney can make. The two numeric axes (`product_centrality`, `defensibility`) reuse platform-side field names; the rationale and recommendation fields are skill-specific.

**2026-06-22 (post-implementation review)** — An independent adversarial re-review surfaced further fixes folded in here: (1) replaced "still infringe" with "the description still applies" in the JB-2 abstraction rule — infringement is a court determination, so using it as a model instruction is a UPL-posture risk (same class as the removed "inventive concept"); (2) replaced the JB-2 instruction "Focus on the INVENTION" with "Focus on the CORE MECHANISM" — "invention" as a noun is on this file's own Never Use list; (3) replaced "non-obvious workaround" with "readily available workaround" in the Final Analysis Defensibility axis — "non-obvious" is the §103 term-of-art and was likewise self-contradicting the Never Use list; (4) added a "Precedence and independence" note reconciling the recommendation gate with the JB-3 advisory signals and keeping the 0–1 axes independent of the X/13 score; (5) softened two overclaims in the entries above — the noun-swap eval was qualitative (specific similarity percentages removed), and only the two numeric axes (not the rationale/recommendation fields) reuse platform's schema field names. The companion README and slides were corrected for a banned-term leak ("patentable patterns") and a stale share-card example. The closure falsifier was widened from a 4-term `*/SKILL.md` grep to the full Never Use vocabulary across all `*.md` files.

**2026-09-13**: Three corrections, made in both scanner skills. (1) **The recommendation rule averaged its two axes.** `(product_centrality + defensibility) / 2 > 0.5` let a high score on one axis make up for a low score on the other, so a pattern scored 0.95 and 0.10 was recommended, although the rule's own `CALIBRATE:` note said a single high score should not trigger it. The rule is now `product_centrality > 0.5 AND defensibility > 0.5`, still marked `CALIBRATE:`. (2) **The reporting threshold admitted zero distinctiveness.** Distinctiveness (0-4) plus three axes of 0-3 let a pattern through at 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. A pattern is now reported only when its total is at least 8 and its Distinctiveness score is at least 2, because levels 0 and 1 describe standard approaches and minor variations on common ones; both values are marked `CALIBRATE:`. The JB-5 step, the JB-3 note, the Final Analysis step and the `_claim_angles_note` field now refer to the reporting threshold instead of restating it as a total, and the no-patterns message states both values. (3) The Final Analysis entry of 2026-06-22 was reworded to remove an internal identifier. The 2026-06-22 entries otherwise describe the rules as they were on that date.
